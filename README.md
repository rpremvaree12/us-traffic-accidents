# Reducing US Traffic Accidents

In this project, I used a dataset on US traffic accidents from February 2016 to March 2023 with the purpose of analyzing the dataset to identify patterns, trends, and factors contributing to accidents. Based on the comprehensive analysis, I provide data-driven insights that a government agency could utilize to reduce traffic accidents and improve road safety. 

As this dataset consists of over 7.7 million rows with 46 columns of data, I cleaned the data by dropping columns with ~50% of missing values and imputing the median for columns between 2-10% of missing values. After those processes, the cleaned data set was transfered to Tableau for dynamic EDA.

This is a countrywide car accident dataset that covers 49 states of the USA. The accident data were collected from February 2016 to March 2023, using multiple APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by various entities, including the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road networks. The dataset currently contains approximately 7.7 million accident records.

### Columns Description
* ID: This is a unique identifier of the accident record.
* Source: Source of raw accident data
* Severity: Shows the severity of the accident, a number between 1 and 4, where 1 indicates the least impact on traffic (i.e., short delay as a result of the accident) and 4 indicates a significant impact on traffic (i.e., long delay).

* Start_Lng: Shows longitude in GPS coordinate of the start point.
* End_Lat: Shows latitude in GPS coordinate of the end point.
* End_Lng: Shows longitude in GPS coordinate of the end point.
* Distance(mi): The length of the road extent affected by the accident in miles.

* Wind_Direction: Shows wind direction.
* Wind_Speed(mph): Shows wind speed (in miles per hour).
* Precipitation(in): Shows precipitation amount in inches, if there is any.
* Weather_Condition: Shows the weather condition (rain, snow, thunderstorm, fog, etc.)
* Amenity: A POI annotation which indicates presence of amenity in a nearby location.
* Bump: A POI annotation which indicates presence of speed bump or hump in a nearby location.
* Crossing: A POI annotation which indicates presence of crossing in a nearby location.

* Railway: A POI annotation which indicates presence of railway in a nearby location.
* Roundabout: A POI annotation which indicates presence of roundabout in a nearby location.
* Station: A POI annotation which indicates presence of station in a nearby location.
* Stop: A POI annotation which indicates presence of stop in a nearby location.
* Traffic_Calming: A POI annotation which indicates presence of traffic_calming in a nearby location.
* Traffic_Signal: A POI annotation which indicates presence of traffic_signal in a nearby location.
* Turning_Loop: A POI annotation which indicates presence of turning_loop in a nearby location.
